# QueueUsingLL-SomeProblems

This repository contains Java implementations and practice problems related to **Queue using Linked List** data structure.  
It demonstrates how to build a queue from scratch using a linked list (without using built-in Java collections), and also includes some common queue-based problems.

## 🧠 About the Implementation

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** principle — the first element added is the first one removed.

In this project:
- A queue is implemented using **linked lists**
- Each node contains data and a reference to the next node
- The queue supports standard operations:
  - `enqueue()` — add element to the rear
  - `dequeue()` — remove element from the front
  - `isEmpty()` — check whether the queue is empty
  - `front()` — view the front element

This helps reinforce how queue data structures work **under the hood**.

## 🧱 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mrutunjaya-Panda/QueueUsingLL-SomeProblems.git
2. Open the project in a Java IDE (VS Code, IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Run the main class:
   QueueUseLL.java or
   QueueUsingLL.java

  These classes demonstrate queue operations in action.
